This is really just a personal project and a rework of my custom twitch bot.  I'm trying to add more usefulness, and interactivity to the bot while also learning more about python.

### Checklist of things I want to implement (expect this to grow!):
* Character system
* Monsters to fight
* Combat
* Armorsmith
* Weaponsmith
* Apothecary
* Quests(?)
* Boss fights
* Crafting(?)
